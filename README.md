# Module 1 Project

## Goals

Given movie data, the goal was to investigate facets of the data that would be beneficial to a new movie production company.

#### Who are the top contributors to the more successful films in regards to gross profit and return on investment?

I was able to show  all the contributors that worked on the top 25 films.  


## Conclusion

The most known actors and actresses appeared in the top 25 as expected.  Including these stars will be recommended for creating a film that will gross successfully and return handsomely on the investment.
