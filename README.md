#### What goes into a successful movie?  

Movie success is financially measured at the box office. Films generate revenue from ticket sales. The movies that gross the highest, will be considered the most successful.  It will be recommended to use a selection of these movies to investigate the facets that make them successful.  The facets investigated were the top grossing films, their genres, and release dates.  Their ROI was calculated and compared to average ratings.  Lastly, the top grossing movies were investigated to determine the top actors and actresses.


## Conclusion  

Based on the results, the best film to produce would be an Action, Adventure film that is released in the summer months of May, June, or July.  This film should also contain performers such as Mark Wahlberg, Emily Blunt, Dwayne Johnson, or Jennifer Lawrence.
